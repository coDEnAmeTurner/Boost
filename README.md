Fly a present-like rocket to its receiver. This game is dedicated to my close friend's birthday, at the same time, practicing what I've learnt so far about Unity Inputs, Simple Physics, Audio Effect, Particle System and Level Design.

This is the second project that I've made using Unity, it's in fact a kind of code-along project I finished while studying Complete C# Unity 3D Game Development by GameDev.tv. It's not big, but a proud accomplishment to me at the time.
